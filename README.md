# graphing_data
basic data types and graphing

This series of 4 files is an activity that I built for my Behavioral Genetics class which is all first semester students some are science majors and some are not.

Here is a brief explanation of the files and a suggested order: 
1. data_variable_types.pdf - this file explains varaible types that are relevant to the class
2. graph_examples.pdf - has, well, examples of graphs (it is really used in conjunction with 3)
3. graphing_tutorial.pdf - this team activity is used by students to explore some data, figure out variable types, and start to think about graphing
4. graphing2.pdf - this used a small/medium sized data set and required teams of students to apply what they had learned

I think it is important for students to both sketch out what they want ahead of time (planning is good) and then also make the graphs with the real data. The current (first) version of this activity was done using Google sheets and charts, I hope to improve future implementations by converting to R markdown and/or a Shiny app.
